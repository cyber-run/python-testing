## How to setup for running scripts

- First create 3.8 python venv => python3.8 -m venv venv38 

- Then activate venv => source venv38/bin/activate

- Then install requirements => pip install -r requirements.txt

- Then run any scripts as required => python <script_name>.py

- /dev/ => is current working folder

## TODO list:

- [ ] Implement motor calibration through app

- [ ] Spawn tracking process with rotation matrix

- [ ] Add upgraded motor (and horns) with new mirror mount hardware

- [ ] Investigate QuadDXL controller for higher control frequency
